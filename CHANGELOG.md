# Changelog

All notable changes to Vitra CSS are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.5] - 2026-07-14

### Removed

- **Dead tokens** `--vitra-color-accent-oklch`, `--vitra-color-bg-warm`, `--vitra-color-bg-cool` — defined at the base and overridden across four theme blocks, never consumed by any `var()` reference anywhere in the codebase. This was audit item 12, marked complete on the internal tracker despite a test still asserting the tokens must exist, which meant they were never actually deleted. Removed from source; the test now asserts they stay gone.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **Glass fallback leaks** — `.vitra-input-glass`, `.vitra-badge-glass`, `.vitra-spinner-glass`, `.vitra-alert-glass`, `.vitra-table-glass` set a translucent `hsl()` background with no `@supports` guard at all, so the glass look silently applied even where `backdrop-filter` isn't supported, with no opaque fallback underneath. Each now gets a solid fallback background outside `@supports`, translucent + blur only inside the positive branch, matching the pattern already used elsewhere in the framework.
- `02-glass.css`'s size-variant fallback rule (`.vitra-glass-sm/md/lg/xl`) was unconditional, silently overriding the enhanced translucent background in every browser that DOES support `backdrop-filter` since both rules matched and the fallback came later in source order. Scoped it to `@supports not (...)`.
- `.vitra-table-stack` had identical rule sets duplicated verbatim under both a `@container` query and a `@media` query, so both fired redundantly in browsers that support container queries. The `@media` fallback is now scoped behind `@supports not (container-type: inline-size)` so only one is ever active.
- `.vitra-container-sm` used the same max-width as plain `.vitra-container` at its md breakpoint (720px) — the "sm" variant wasn't actually narrower. Added `--vitra-container-narrow` (560px) and pointed the class at it.
- `dropdown.init()`/`spotlight.init()` ran unconditionally on `DOMContentLoaded` regardless of `data-config`, unlike `ripple`/`tooltip` which already respect a `!== false` opt-out. Both now gate on `config.dropdown`/`config.spotlight`.
- `vitra.d.ts` was stale against the runtime module: the `ripple` module and `destroyAll()` weren't declared at all, and `destroy()` was missing from the `Toast`/`Dropdown`/`Spotlight` interfaces. Synced all four; added a drift-guard test that diffs `Object.keys()` of each runtime module against its declared interface so future drift fails CI instead of shipping silently-wrong types.

### Added

- CI now fails a tagged release if `package.json`'s version doesn't match the pushed git tag (`v*`).

## [1.8.3] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **Themes given distinct hues** — `light` and `dark` previously both fell back to the base token hue (177°), making them read as near-identical besides brightness; `neon` (180°) and `emerald` (155°) were also only a few degrees from that same base hue. All 7 themes now sit at deliberately separated hues across the wheel (dark 177, light 222, emerald 145, ocean 205, neon 285, pastel 330), so switching themes actually changes color character, not just contrast — this is most visible in the scenery backdrop, which derives its palette from the same accent-hue tokens.
- **Scenery contrast tuned per color-scheme** — ridge opacity was a flat constant regardless of theme; on light-scheme themes (`light`, `pastel`) the translucent mist bands were washing out against a bright sky. Light-scheme themes now get heavier ridge opacity and a dialed-back sky glow to keep the horizon legible.
- **Parallax now drifts one direction, true loop** — ridges previously used `ease-in-out infinite alternate`, which reads as layers breathing back and forth rather than a camera pan. Each ridge's SVG silhouette is now tiled twice inside a 200%-wide strip; animating `translate3d(0%) -> translate3d(-50%)` linear/infinite lands on a frame pixel-identical to the start, so the loop is seamless and travels one direction only (near ridge fastest, far ridge slowest — real depth-parallax cue).

### Fixed

- Far/mid ridge SVG paths had a vertical mismatch between their start and end anchor points (26px / 30px), which would have shown as a visible step at the tile seam once ridges became seamless loops — corrected so each path's edges meet at the same height.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- `rootMargin` option on `Vitra.reveal.init()` — lets consumers pre-trigger reveals before elements enter the viewport (e.g. `'0px 0px 15% 0px'`). Typed in `vitra.d.ts` (with previously missing `scrollReveal`).

### Changed

- **Scenery silhouettes redrawn as a painterly panorama**: flowing cubic-bezier ridgeline with summit hierarchy (dominant massif, secondary summit, eroded round valleys, asymmetric slopes) replacing the uniform zigzag; sun repositioned to sit cradled in the saddle between massifs.

### Fixed

- **Reveal stagger used the global element index** — an element revealed alone still waited `(its index) × stagger` ms after entering the viewport, so late-page sections appeared up to seconds late. Stagger is now per-visibility-batch.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- **Scenery performance overhaul** — the whole system now animates on the compositor only:
  - `filter: blur()` removed from ridge layers (was re-rasterizing 130%-wide surfaces); atmospheric haze now comes from translucent mist-band gradients at each ridge top.
  - Grain layer dropped `mix-blend-mode: overlay` (forced full-stack re-blend every animation frame); now plain low opacity.
  - Drift keyframes use `translate3d` to pin each ridge to its own compositor layer; `contain: strict` on both scenery roots.
- **Scenery silhouettes reworked**: far ridge is a dense-detail alpine range (36 points, dominant massif, micro-jitter rock texture), mid ridge mixes sharp spurs with rounded shoulders overlapping the far range's valleys, near ridge is a soft dark treeline. Valley-fog mist bands between ranges strengthen depth separation.

### Removed

- `--vitra-scenery-blur-far/-mid/-near` tokens (obsolete with the no-filter design; introduced in 1.8.0).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Scenery system** (`src/09-scenery.css`, new `@layer scenery`): CSS-only ambient mountain-landscape backdrop. SVG-silhouette ridgelines at three depths (shape from inline SVG masks, color from theme tokens), crisp sun/moon disc with layered glow, atmospheric-perspective haze, differential-speed parallax drift, grain finish. Two modes: `.vitra-scenery` (full-page fixed) and `.vitra-scenery-inline` (container-scoped). Graceful gradient fallback where `mask-image` is unsupported; static under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- `:focus-visible` rings on `.vitra-btn` and `.vitra-dropdown-item` (previously `outline: none` with no replacement on dropdown items).
- `Vitra.toast.destroy()` — clears pending timeouts, removes the toast container; wired into `Vitra.destroyAll()`.
- Governance docs: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1), this `CHANGELOG.md`.
- CI: Windows build matrix (ubuntu + windows), `npm audit --audit-level=high` gate, weekly Dependabot (npm + github-actions).
- Root `index.html` demo page (scenery + glass panel + theme switcher).

### Changed

- Input validation states (`.vitra-input-valid` / `.vitra-input-invalid`) now use compound-selector specificity instead of `!important`.
- Reduced-motion coverage extended: toast transitions, dropdown menu, input-invalid shake, spotlight.
- `size-limit` budgets corrected to brotli-realistic gates (CSS 16 kB, JS 6 kB, ESM 8 kB vs 13.7/4.4/6.2 kB actual).
- Dev dependencies refreshed via `npm audit fix` (0 known vulnerabilities).

### Fixed

- **`@layer` order bug**: layer statement declared `layout` before `motion`, contradicting the documented and build-concatenation order — motion rules could lose cascade conflicts they should win.
- **Google Fonts `@import` removed** from `01-tokens.css` — the framework no longer triggers a third-party network request; fonts are opt-in for consumers.
- Emoji particles rendered twice (both `textContent` and CSS `::before` via `data-emoji`); now single render path.
- Toast `setTimeout` chain leaked timers if the page tore down mid-animation.
- Duplicate `.vitra-grid` declaration in utilities layer removed (layout layer owns it).

### Removed

- Orphaned `.vitra-slider-*` CSS fragments — no base `.vitra-slider` class ever shipped, despite the v1.0 changelog listing sliders. Corrected here.

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Glass components (`navbar`, `drawer`, `dropdown-menu`, `tooltip`, `toast`): hardcoded dark `hsl()` replaced with `--vitra-glass-bg` tokens; `@supports (backdrop-filter)` guards added.
- `ripple.destroy()` now actually removes its listener; double-init guarded.
